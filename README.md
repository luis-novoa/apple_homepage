# apple_homepage
Learning project with emphasis on training how to set up backgrounds on CSS3 and HTML5. My task is to replicate an old version of the Apple homepage, as proposed by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-backgrounds-and-gradients). This is part of the Microverse curriculum. [Here](https://raw.githack.com/luis-novoa/apple_homepage/homepage/index.html) you can check how the page looks like right now.
