# apple_homepage

Learning project with emphasis on training how to set up backgrounds on CSS3 and HTML5. My task is to replicate an old version of the Apple homepage, as proposed by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-backgrounds-and-gradients). This is part of the Microverse curriculum. [Here](https://raw.githack.com/luis-novoa/apple_homepage/homepage/index.html) you can check how the page looks like right now.

#Workflow
1 - Create the github repository
2 - Create a branch to work on (never code in the master branch).
3 - Download every image used on the homepage.
4 - Write the entire HTML structure of the page.
5 - Style the page from top to bottom using CSS, creating sections corresponding to the main elements of the page and respecting the order in which the labels are presented in HTML.
6 - Save your progress constantly on github. This ensures plenty of returning points in case they are needed.
7 - After finishing the project, send the HTML and CSS files to an online file validators.
